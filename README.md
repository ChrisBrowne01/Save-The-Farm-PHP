# Save-The-Farm-PHP

Codecademy Save-The-Farm project using PHP. A fun interactive project that I enjoyed to make so much that I'd thought I'd share it with you.

## Project Overview

Welcome to the world of [interactive fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction). In this project, you’ll be building a text adventure game called **Save the Farm!**

This is a Save the Farm web application built using PHP. The app allows users to input a one of serval commands provided and recieve an outcome that will take them on a an adventure to find a golden status.

## About

### Save the Farm!

*Hello there. It’s been a harrowing few weeks. First your toenail issue, and now Great-Aunt Natasha’s emu farm is in danger of being repossessed! So here you are—after a brief stopover at the Mayo Clinic—in Uncle Boris’s remote cabin in the heart of the Terror Woods. Family legend holds that a golden statue of immense value is hidden somewhere within these walls…*


You’ll be practicing everything you’ve learned about booleans, conditionals, and logical operators to create a fun, silly game. You can customize the game to your taste. Once you’ve completed this project, you’ll understand the mechanics of building an interactive text game, so, from there, the world is your oyster (as Uncle Boris always used to say).

Take your time and have fun!
